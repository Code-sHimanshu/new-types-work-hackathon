# 🏺 Join Pottery Workshop

An interactive 3D pottery workshop UI built with **Three.js** and **GSAP**, offering users a creative experience of shaping and interacting with virtual pottery. Move your mouse to experience the parallax effect and enjoy smooth animations in real time.

## 🎨 Inspiration

While exploring Three.js and its shapes, I was inspired to design a pottery workshop UI that brings the art of pottery-making to life digitally. The idea of shaping 3D objects in real-time fascinated me, and using GSAP for fluid animations added an interactive touch. This project became a creative way to merge design, animation, and code.

## 💡 Features

- Interactive 3D pottery creation experience
- Parallax effect that responds to mouse movements
- Smooth animations using GSAP
- Beautiful starry background for a calming workshop vibe

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Three.js** - 3D rendering library
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool
- **GSAP** - Animation library for smooth transitions
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** - Front-end technologies for structure, styling, and logic

## 🚧 Challenges

- Placing stars randomly in the background
- Correctly mapping textures onto the 3D objects

These challenges helped me better understand coordinate systems, scene management, and texture handling in Three.js.

## 🎉 Accomplishments

- Successfully created a responsive parallax effect
- Applied textures and animations to 3D objects
- Enhanced user interaction with seamless UI experience

## 📚 What We Learned

- Mastered Three.js basics and object transformations
- Learned to create engaging animations using GSAP
- Improved scene optimization and rendering skills

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add more customization options for pottery shapes and textures
- Implement a feature to save or export 3D models
- Optimize the experience for mobile devices and touch gestures
